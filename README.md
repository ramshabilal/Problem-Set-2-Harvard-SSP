I. Operator and If Practice  
- Create three variables: x, y, z, all integers and a double called d.  
- Set x and y each to 10  
- Add one to x using the = and + operators. Display  
- Add one to x using the ++ operator. Display  
- Add one to x using the += operator. Display  
- Set y to 4 and z to 8. Divide z by y and store the result in x. Display  
- Divide y by z and store the result in d. Display. (The result should be .5)  
- If x is greater than 0, add 10 to x. Display x.  
- If x is greater than 0 and y is less than 10, add 1 to d. Display x, y, d  
- If x is greater than 0 or y is less than 10, add 1 to d. Display x, y, d  
  
II. Joe’s Hotdogs- v.2  
Update your Joe’s hotdogs program as follows:  
- If there are no items in the order, let the user know and end the program.  
- Apply a 10% discount if the order is at least $20 (before sales tax is added)  
- Display the result to exactly 2 decimal places using the formatting techniques we learned in
class.  
  
III. Fibonacci Sequence  
A Fibonacci Sequence follow the pattern: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 …  
where the next element is always the sum of the last two elements.  
The series is always seeded with 0, 1  
This sequence carries great significance in mathematics and proportions in nature – You may want to
read up on it for fun. https://www.livescience.com/37470-fibonacci-sequence.html  

Your assignment is to create and store a Fibonacci sequence and then display it.  
Part 1: Create an array of up to 30 numbers. Ask the user how many numbers they want displayed
in the sequence. The number they enter must be between 1 and 30. If it is not, continue to ask for
the size until they enter a valid number.  

You may assume the user is entering integers only. You only need to validate for the value of the
number.
Note: you must completely create and store the sequence in an array before displaying it.
Part 2: Redo this part of the assignment using a vector&lt;T&gt; instead of an array.
